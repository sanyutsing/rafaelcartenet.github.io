## About me

I am currently a young principal investigator at the [Research Institute of Intelligent Complex Systems](https://iics.fudan.edu.cn/) at Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

I was a postdoc fellow at [the School of Mathematical Sciences at Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/), Shanghai, China.

I received my Phd degree and Msc degree in Mathematics from [the University of British Columbia](https://www.math.ubc.ca/), Vancouver, Canada, under the supervision of Prof. [Li, Dong](https://hkumath.hku.hk/MathWWW/people.php?faculty.dl) and Prof. [Wetton, Brian](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~wetton/).

I received my Bsc degree in Mathematics (with Honors, First Class) in 2015 from [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/), Hong Kong, China.

I graduated from Nantong Middle School of Jiangsu Province （江苏省南通中学）and was ranked top 200 in the entrance examination （高考） in Jiangsu Province.

I was born in1993, in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province (江苏省南通市); I can speak Mandarin, English, Cantonese and Nantong dialect fluently (FYI: There are 6 different dialects in the greater Nantong area and I can understand most of them but can only speak Nantonese, i.e. 南通话). I can also speak a little bit of hokkien (闽南话) because of my wife Catherine.
